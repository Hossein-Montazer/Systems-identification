# Diagnosis of Epilepcy with EEG Data in Presence of Fulty Channel
For diagnosing the diseases automatically, a device should be created that can classify between sick and healthy people and various diseases. Here we want to suggest a way to classify EEG data of healthy and epileptic person. In the following, we will examine the case that if there is a problem in one of the signal reception channels, will there be a problem in diagnosing the disease. We will try to reconstruct the faulty signal with data obtained from other channels. Then we will show that the diagnosis will be improved after reconstruction.
